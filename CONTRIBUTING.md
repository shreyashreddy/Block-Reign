# Contributing to This Project

First off — respect for even thinking about contributing.  
Open-source runs on curiosity, late nights, and people who actually care. ⚙️🔥

This document explains **how to contribute properly** so we don’t break things accidentally.

---

## 🧠 Before You Start

- Make sure you understand **what this project does**
- Read the `README.md`
- Check existing **Issues** and **Pull Requests**
- If unsure, ask — guessing silently is how bugs are born 🐛

## 🛠 How to Contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

- 🐞 Reporting bugs  
- ✨ Suggesting features  
- 🧩 Improving code quality  
- 📝 Fixing typos / improving docs  
- 🚀 Performance optimizations  

Every contribution matters. Small fixes count.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

When opening an issue, include:

- Clear **title**
- Steps to **reproduce the bug**
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs (if applicable)

Bad bug report:  
> “It doesn’t work”

Good bug report:  
> “Game crashes when player reaches level 3 on Firefox”

Clarity saves time. Time saves sanity.

## 🌟 Feature Requests

Have an idea? Cool. But:

- Explain **what problem it solves**
- Explain **why it fits this project**
- Keep it realistic (no “AI that reads my mind” yet 🤖)

Not every idea will be accepted — and that’s okay.
